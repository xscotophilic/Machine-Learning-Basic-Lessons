# Solve Support Vector Regression (SVR) in R Language
> In most Linear regression models & Polynomial regression models, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors.
>  Support Vector Regression (SVR) gives us the flexibility to define how much error is acceptable in our model and will find an appropriate line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to fit the data.
